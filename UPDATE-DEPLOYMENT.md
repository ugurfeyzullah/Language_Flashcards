# ðŸ”§ Update Your PythonAnywhere Deployment

Your fixes have been pushed to GitHub! Now you need to update your PythonAnywhere deployment with the latest changes.

## Quick Update Steps

### 1. Pull Latest Changes
In your PythonAnywhere **Bash console**:

```bash
cd ~/Language_Flashcards
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Reload Your Web App
- Go to the **Web** tab
- Click the green **"Reload ugurfeyzullah.pythonanywhere.com"** button

That's it! Your fixes are now live.

## What Was Fixed

### âœ… **Session Persistence Issue**
- **Problem**: Login sessions were not surviving browser restarts
- **Fix**: Updated session cookie configuration for better persistence
- **Result**: Users will now stay logged in even after closing/reopening browser

### âœ… **Mobile Keyboard Issue**  
- **Problem**: Mobile keyboards not showing properly on login forms
- **Fix**: Added proper mobile input attributes:
  - `autocomplete` for password managers
  - `autocapitalize="none"` for usernames/emails
  - `autocorrect="off"` to prevent auto-correction
  - `spellcheck="false"` for better UX
- **Result**: Mobile keyboards now work correctly on all devices

## Test Your Fixes

After reloading, test these scenarios:

1. **Session Persistence**:
   - Log in to your app
   - Close the browser completely
   - Reopen and visit your site
   - âœ… You should still be logged in

2. **Mobile Keyboard**:
   - Open your site on a mobile device
   - Try to log in or register
   - âœ… Keyboard should appear immediately when tapping input fields
   - âœ… Appropriate keyboard type should show (email keyboard for email field, etc.)

## If Issues Persist

If you still have problems:

1. **Check Error Logs**: Web tab â†’ Error log
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Test in Incognito/Private Mode**: Rules out browser cache issues

Your app should now work perfectly on both desktop and mobile! ðŸ“±ðŸ’»
