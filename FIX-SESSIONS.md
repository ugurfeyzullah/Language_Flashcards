# ðŸ”§ Fix Session & Mobile Issues

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Sessions resetting on refresh** - Fixed SECRET_KEY consistency
2. **Mobile keyboard not working** - Added proper input attributes

## Deploy Updates to PythonAnywhere:

### 1. Update Code
```bash
cd ~/Language_Flashcards
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Check Session Debug (Optional)
Visit: `https://ugurfeyzullah.pythonanywhere.com/api/debug/session`

This will show session information. Look for:
- `"has_user_id": true` (if logged in)
- `"session_permanent": true` 
- `"secret_key_set": true`

### 3. Reload Web App
- Web tab â†’ Click "Reload ugurfeyzullah.pythonanywhere.com"

## Test the Fixes:

### Session Persistence Test:
1. Log in to your app
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen and visit site
4. âœ… Should still be logged in

### Mobile Keyboard Test:
1. Open on mobile device
2. Try login/register
3. âœ… Keyboard should appear immediately
4. âœ… No autocorrect on username/email fields

## If Still Having Issues:

### For Session Problems:
- Make sure WSGI file has the same SECRET_KEY every time
- Check error logs for any session-related errors
- Try logging out and back in

### For Mobile Keyboard:
- Try different browsers on mobile
- Clear browser cache
- Check if specific letters are not working (might be keyboard language issue)

**Important**: The debug endpoint at `/api/debug/session` shows sensitive info - remove it later by commenting out that route in server.py once everything works!
